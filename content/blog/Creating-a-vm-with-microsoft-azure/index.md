## The problem

I wanted to do my google certifications exams but I had an issue, my latency tests were failing due to slow internet connection. My alternative was to look for a good remote virtual machine to help me work on my certificatons exams.

After evaluating the options that were available online I decided to go with [Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/). It has a free plan and provides what I need to get my exams done.
So I'm gonna guide you on how to set up a Windows virtual machine on your macOs PC.

## Setting Up the VM on Azure

1. First register into <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>, you don't have an account.

<br/>

2. Navigate to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#home)

<br/>

<br/>

5. Now let's Create a Virtual Machine.
      - Select the subscription as default.
      - create a new resource group on the subscription resource group.
      - Give your VM a name on the virtual machine Name.
      - You can leave the default region setting
      - on availability, option choose Availability zone and give it availability zone of 2
      - The image we are going to use Windows 10 pro.
      - Select Size, on a free plan; the size offered is F2s_v2 so choose select size remove the filter search options and then search for it. Choose it and hit select which is at the bottom left of the page
          <br/>

          ![Select VM size](./select-size.png)
          <br/>
      - Create an Administrator account for your VM. Enter your preferred Username and password. Make sure to keep them somewhere.
      - on the inbound port rules. Choose allow selected ports and then select RDP which will enable us to connect to our remote desktop
      - by now we should have such configurations:

      - Click Review and Create and wait for the validations to pass
        <br/>

        ![Create VM](./create-vm.png)
        <br/>
      - Now click create and wait for your VM to be deployed. It will take a few minutes.

## Create a RDP connection

After the virtual machine has been deployed, you can now click on `Go to the Resource` button and it will provide with a nice dashboard of your VM.

    - Click add, it will create the PC

4. Next double click on the created PC. It will start connecting to your VM
5. If the certificate warning comes up you can click continue
