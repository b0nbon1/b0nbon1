We use the `fs` module in Nodejs which allows you to work with the file systems on your computer.
You just Nodejs installed on your computer because `fs` module is part of the Nodejs core.

## Read Files

You can readfiles from your nodejs application using `fs.readFile` anf `fs.readFileSync`(for synchronous form) methods.

Examples for reading files:

#### Synchronous example

```js
const fs = require('fs');

try {
  const fileFetched = fs.readFileSync('./');
} catch (error) {
  console.log(error)
}

```
