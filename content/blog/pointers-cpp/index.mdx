A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of an object.
As we all know in C++ every variable is memory location and every memory location has its address defined which can be accessed using `&` operator also know as reference operator, which refers to address in memory.

An example of how to get memory location using `&` operator:
```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main () {
   int  num;
   char letters[10];

   cout << "Address of num variable: ";
   cout << &num << endl;
   // returns
   // Address of num variable: 0xbfebd5c0

   cout << "Address of letters variable: ";
   cout << &letters << endl;
   // returns bellow
   // Address of letters variable: 0xbfebd5b6

   return 0;
}
```
`0xbfebd5c0` and `0xbfebd5b6` are the memory addresses where these varaibles are stored in.


The addresses above can be stored in pointer. Like any variable or constant you must declare a pointer before you work with it.

`type *var-name`

we declare the type of the what being stored in that address, then we have the asterisk known as Dereference operator (*) which is used to refer the varaible as a pointer and the varaible name of that pointer.

Here are valid pointers:
```cpp
int    *x;    // a pointer to integer
double *x;    // a pointer to double
float  *x;    // a pointer to float
char   *ch     // a pointer to a character
```

### How to use a pointer
1. Define a pointer varaible
2. Assigning the address of a variable to a pointer using reference operator(&) which returns the address of that variable.
3. accessing the value stored in the address using Dereference operator(*) which returns the value of the variable stored at that address

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main () {
   int  num = 20;

  // declare pointer variable
   int* ptr;

   // note that data type of ptr and var must be same
    ptr = &num; 

   cout << "Value at ptr: ";
   cout << ptr << endl;
   // returns
   // Value at ptr:  0xbfebd5c0

   cout << "value at num: ";
   cout << num << endl;
   // returns bellow
   // value at num: 20

   cout << "value at *ptr: ";
   cout << *ptr << endl;
   // returns bellow
   // value at *ptr: 20

   return 0;
}
```

> There are three ways to declare pointer variables, but the first way is preferred:

```cpp
string* mystring; // Preferred
string *mystring;
string * mystring;
```

#### Working of C++ Pointers

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int var = 5;

    // declare pointer variable
    int* pointVar;

    // store address of var
    pointVar = &var;

    // print value of var
    cout << "var = " << var << endl;

    // print address of var
    cout << "Address of var (&var) = " << &var << endl
         << endl;

    // print pointer pointVar
    cout << "pointVar = " << pointVar << endl;

    // print the content of the address pointVar points to
    cout << "Content of the address pointed to by pointVar (*pointVar) = " << *pointVar << endl;
    
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
var = 5
Address of var (&var) = 0x61ff08

pointVar = 0x61ff08
Content of the address pointed to by pointVar (*pointVar) = 5
```

#### Changing Value Pointed by Pointers

If `pointVar` points to the address of `var`, we can change the value of `var` by using `*pointVar`.

For example:

```cpp
int var = 5;
int* pointVar;

// assign address of var
pointVar = &var;

// change value at address pointVar
*pointVar = 1;

cout << var << endl; // Output: 1
```

Another Example of changing value by pointers:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int var = 5;
    int* pointVar;

    // store address of var
    pointVar = &var;

    // print var
    cout << "var = " << var << endl;

    // print *pointVar
    cout << "*pointVar = " << *pointVar << endl
         << endl;

    cout << "Changing value of var to 7:" << endl;

    // change value of var to 7
    var = 7;

    // print var
    cout << "var = " << var << endl;

    // print *pointVar
    cout << "*pointVar = " << *pointVar << endl
         << endl;

    cout << "Changing value of *pointVar to 16:" << endl;

    // change value of var to 16
    *pointVar = 16;

    // print var
    cout << "var = " << var << endl;

    // print *pointVar
    cout << "*pointVar = " << *pointVar << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
var = 5
*pointVar = 5

Changing value of var to 7:
var = 7
*pointVar = 7

Changing value of *pointVar to 16:
var = 16
*pointVar = 16
```

## Wrapping up

Volla, We know have a basic understanding of pointers.
Pointers have many but easy concepts and they are very important to C++ programming. We can read more about Null pointers, pointer Arithmetic, Pointer to Pointer, passing Pointers to functions, passing references as parameters to understand more about parameters
