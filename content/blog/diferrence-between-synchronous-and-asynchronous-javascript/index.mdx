Asynchronous programming allows you to offload work. That way you can perform that work without blocking the main process/thread (for instance navigation and utilization of the app). It’s often related to parallelization, the art of performing independent tasks in parallel, that is achieved by using asynchronous programming.

With parallelization, you can break what is normally processed sequentially, meaning break it into smaller pieces that can run independently and simultaneously. Parallelization is not just related to processes and capabilities but also with the way systems and software are designed. The biggest advantage of applying parallelization principles is that you can achieve the outcomes much faster and it makes your system easier to evolve and more resilient to failure.

Pretty cool, right? However, not all processes should follow parallelization principles and execute asynchronously. In this blog post, I’ll explain when you should apply asynchronous programming and when sticking to synchronous execution is the best option.

## Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Programming in Javascript
**Synchronous JavaScript**: As the name suggests synchronous means to be in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement to get executed.
Let us understand this with the help of an example.

```js
  console.log("First Statement");

  console.log("Second statement");

  console.log("Last statement");

  //output
  // First Statement
  // Second statement
  // Last statement
```

From the above example, operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one is completed, the following is unblocked. In other words, you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one. 


**Asynchronous JavaScript**: Asynchronous code allows the program to be executed immediately where the synchronous code will block further execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one. This may not look like a big problem but when you see it in a bigger picture you realize that it may lead to delaying the User Interface.

```js
  console.log("First Statement");

  setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Second statement");
  }, 2000);

  console.log("Last statement");

  //output
  // First Statement
  // Last statement
  // Second statement
```

So, what the code does is first it logs in Hi then rather than executing the setTimeout function it logs in End and then it runs the setTimeout function.

At first, as usual, the Fist statement got logged in. As we use browsers to run JavaScript, there are the web APIs that handle these things for users. So, what JavaScript does is, it passes the setTimeout function in such web API and then we keep on running our code as usual. So it does not block the rest of the code from executing and after all the code its execution, it gets pushed to the call stack and then finally gets executed. This is what happens in asynchronous JavaScript.

from the above example, asynchronous operations, on the other hand, you can move to another task before the previous one finishes. This way, with asynchronous programming you’re able to deal with multiple requests simultaneously, thus completing more tasks in a much shorter period of time.
