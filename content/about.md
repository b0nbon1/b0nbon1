I'm a software engineer with a wide range of skills, constantly learning something new every day. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful and intuitive.

I'm currently working on [Stratal.io][stratal] an automation tool for everyone.

My current day-to-day at work involves:

- maintaining and refactoring a large legacy Nextjs Code.
- building all the newer parts of the codebase in Golang and newer Nextjs version
- Building tools for automation using Typescript and Golang.
- some frontend work (Nextjs, Typescript)

Sometimes I [write][blog] about stuff I've learned, personal projects, and anything else I find interesting.
